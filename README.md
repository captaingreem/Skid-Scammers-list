#### **Disclaimer:** *this repo was skidded by CryptoScem [here](https://github.com/0xCryptix/list-of-scammers) with false informations about Zentoh. Zentoh has only 1 github, [0x32Moon](https://github.com/0x32Moon), he gave no proof because there are no one other, "terminated shop 2 times" is also fake because this is not the terminated error, the shop is just not existing ü§° Stay safe and beware of scams* 
Zentoh is a good guy, also legit for paid things, that's just why I'm not talking him here
